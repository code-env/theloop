# Goal setting module

The aim of this module is to enable startups to set a goal that they want to achieve by a certain date.

After creating a goal, they can send recurrent progress reports regarding that goal.
They can also set how recurrent they want to send reports regarding one of their goals.
They should be able to view their streaks.

Once a goal is created, it can only be deleted along with all associated data.
Once a goal is complete, it should no longer show on their dashboard.

A goal has a title and description.
Then there are subsequent reports regarding a goal (misc).
A goal could be special and relate to customers etc.

A goal should have a bunch of tasks related to it that can be ticked off on a regular basis.
A goal log can also be custom and not related to a particular task but a goal is complete iff all tasks are ticked off.
